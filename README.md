> ##### We used the serverless framework to create a hipchat bot that you can deploy in 3 minutes. We have an example of this repository in action, where we report on a 1:n cloudwatch alarms in different SNS topics, direct to the hipchat glance - for realtime status on your applications!

### Background

In conjunction with AWS and Atlassian, we developed an open source Serverless boilerplate project that allows HipChat plugin developers to deploy plugins using just S3, Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway.

This is a demonstration of an example plugin we built to show a summary of cloudwatch alarms for different applications in our HipChat rooms.
